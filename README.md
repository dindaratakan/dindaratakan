Hello there,

I was born in Izmir, Turkey in 1998. I met the computer when I was 12 years old. And I loved playing games.

After that, I was no longer interested in gaming. So I turned to software.

I took part in big projects.

Technologies I use

PHP, Mysql (PDO), HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Jquery, React JS, Vue JS, Rest Api
